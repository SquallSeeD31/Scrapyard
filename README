The Scrapyard plugin is a plugin that will consume used materials (Armor, tools, weapons) and return by chance none, some or all of its constituent valuable component as defined in the item database.

For Scrapyard to work, the YardSale plugin is required. (Executed when a YardSale sign with "Event: Scrapyard" is used.)

Those are the config options:
All of them are optional, as there are default values defined.
Cost is the percentual amount in decimal form(between 0 and 1) of what what would mostly be lost when using the system. Formula: ((Durability / Max Durability) * (1 - Cost))
(config.yml)
---------
options:
	cost: <DOUBLE>
	defaultColor: <COLORNAME>
	errorColor: <COLORNAME>
	successColor: <COLORNAME>
	dataColor: <COLORNAME>
---------

The default values are:
options.cost = 0.25
options.messageColor = Aqua
options.successColor = Green
options.errorColor = Dark_Red
options.dataColor = Gold


The item database consists of the items allowed to be scrapped, the material and the amount of into what it would be scrapped.
(itemdb.yml)
---------
items:
	<ITEM>:
		material: <MATERIAL>
		amount: <INTEGER>
---------

<ITEM> and <MATERIAL> can either be the item id or the item string. (The string can either be like ITEM_STRING, item_string or item string)
Example:
---------
items:
	gold spade:
		material: GOLD_INGOT
		amount: 1
	iron_pickaxe:
		material: 265
		amount: 3
	269:
		material: WOOD
		amount: 1
